@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

@dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n ==== Gas Costs\n Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":2054,"linearizedBaseContracts":[2054,1564,2079,1642,2788,689],"name":"ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable","nameLocation":"2502:24:10","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"body":{"id":1722,"nodeType":"Block","src":"2626:7:10","statements":[]},"id":1723,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[{"id":1720,"kind":"modifierInvocation","modifierName":{"id":1719,"name":"onlyInitializing","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":634,"src":"2609:16:10"},"nodeType":"ModifierInvocation","src":"2609:16:10"}],"name":"__ERC20Snapshot_init","nameLocation":"2577:20:10","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":1718,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"2597:2:10"},"returnParameters":{"id":1721,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"2626:0:10"},"scope":2054,"src":"2568:65:10","stateMutability":"nonpayable","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"body":{"id":1728,"nodeType":"Block","src":"2707:7:10","statements":[]},"id":1729,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[{"id":1726,"kind":"modifierInvocation","modifierName":{"id":1725,"name":"onlyInitializing","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":634,"src":"2690:16:10"},"nodeType":"ModifierInvocation","src":"2690:16:10"}],"name":"__ERC20Snapshot_init_unchained","nameLocation":"2648:30:10","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":1724,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"2678:2:10"},"returnParameters":{"id":1727,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"2707:0:10"},"scope":2054,"src":"2639:75:10","stateMutability":"nonpayable","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"id":1733,"libraryName":{"id":1730,"name":"ArraysUpgradeable","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":2746,"src":"2916:17:10"},"nodeType":"UsingForDirective","src":"2910:38:10","typeName":{"baseType":{"id":1731,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"2938:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"id":1732,"nodeType":"ArrayTypeName","src":"2938:9:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_array$_t_uint256_$dyn_storage_ptr","typeString":"uint256[]"}}},{"id":1737,"libraryName":{"id":1734,"name":"CountersUpgradeable","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":2862,"src":"2959:19:10"},"nodeType":"UsingForDirective","src":"2953:58:10","typeName":{"id":1736,"nodeType":"UserDefinedTypeName","pathNode":{"id":1735,"name":"CountersUpgradeable.Counter","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":2794,"src":"2983:27:10"},"referencedDeclaration":2794,"src":"2983:27:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_struct$_Counter_$2794_storage_ptr","typeString":"struct

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.","events":{"Snapshot(uint256)":{"details":"Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created."}},"kind":"dev","methods":{"allowance(address,address)":{"details":"See {IERC20-allowance}."},"approve(address,uint256)":{"details":"See {IERC20-approve}.

contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\",\"events\":{\"Snapshot(uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"allowance(address,address)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-allowance}.\"},\"approve(address,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-approve}.

It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused.

By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\\n * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\\n *\\n * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\\n * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\\n * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\\n * and the account address.\\n *\\n * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\\n * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\\n * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\\n *\\n * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs.

Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\\n * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\\n * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\\n *\\n * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\\n * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\\n * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\\n */\\n\\nabstract contract ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable is Initializable, ERC20Upgradeable {\\n    function __ERC20Snapshot_init() internal onlyInitializing {\\n    }\\n\\n    function __ERC20Snapshot_init_unchained() internal onlyInitializing {\\n    }\\n    // Inspired by Jordi Baylina's MiniMeToken to record historical balances:\\n    // https://github.com/Giveth/minime/blob/ea04d950eea153a04c51fa510b068b9dded390cb/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol\\n\\n    using ArraysUpgradeable for uint256[];\\n    using CountersUpgradeable for CountersUpgradeable.Counter;\\n\\n    // Snapshotted values have arrays of ids and the value corresponding to that id.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.
